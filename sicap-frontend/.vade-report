# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights in the sicap-frontend React + Vite application.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **sicap-frontend/src/main.tsx**
   - Added import for `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
   - Integrated the `<SpeedInsights />` component within the app's provider hierarchy
   - Placed the component inside the `AuthProvider` to ensure it tracks authenticated user sessions

2. **sicap-frontend/package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` as a new dependency

3. **sicap-frontend/package-lock.json**
   - Updated to reflect the new dependency installation

## Implementation Details

The SpeedInsights component was added to the main entry point (`main.tsx`) following the official Vercel documentation for React applications. The component is positioned at the root level of the application, wrapped within the existing provider hierarchy (ThemeProvider > AuthProvider) to ensure proper tracking across all routes.

The implementation follows the pattern:
```tsx
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';

// Inside ReactDOM.createRoot:
<AuthProvider>
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
  <SpeedInsights />
</AuthProvider>
```

This placement ensures that Speed Insights will:
- Track performance metrics across all routes handled by react-router-dom
- Work within the authentication context
- Be initialized once when the application starts

## Build Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ All dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Production bundle generated without issues

## Next Steps
Once the application is deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard under Project Settings
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script will be automatically injected
3. Performance metrics will start being collected after the first deployment
4. View analytics in the Vercel Dashboard under the "Speed Insights" tab

## Notes
- The implementation uses `@vercel/speed-insights/react` which is the recommended package for React applications
- No additional configuration is required; Speed Insights will automatically track Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics
- The integration is non-blocking and won't affect application performance
